Monu and Dada</br>
Aakash is actually my life.</br>
I always try to protect him because I never want to loose him. .He understands me very well . Many a times I scold him and he gets upset.</br>
At that time, I feel very bad,I feel Like saying him sorry, but it becomes difficult for me to apologies to my younger brother. .</br> 
He is blessed with blessings from Lord Rama. I want to thank god for his blessings on him and on our family .</br>
I know one day he will achieve great heights an d people will respect him alot.</br> 
I wish him a very a good luck for his future .</br>
Lastly I would like to say to you, that Aakash please never feel alone, I will be with you forever and will always love u lot. .</br>
God bless u bro...

This fellow is literally a god like creature to us.</br>
There is no single person in our college who doesn't know his name. </br>
His name itself is a brand. Because this guy helped every single person in our Class/Department.<br>
Even this guy have helped many students within campus and out of campus to complete there Major Project.</br>
And this guy is so amazingly? brilliant that he scored 10 on 10 pointer even after helping the students including Me in our study's? from day before the exams till the the moment we enter the class after that we are on our own because that guy won't help you to cheat.</br>
One of the most remarkable scheme is been launched by this guy in our department and we call it as “The Shadow Faculty”.</br>
In Shadow Faculty students with some extra calibar get stage and opportunity to show their teaching skills.</br>
And any student can teach if he is good at that perticular topic or chapter.</br>
And This guy have helped many start-ups for developing their product for free.</br>
 Even after helping so many people he managed to get pleased, and also helped many to get pleased.</br>
This guy also work in many NGO's so that he can provide them with whatever he have.</br>
If you are friend or enemy if you ever call for help this guy will always be there to help you without thinking of his position or whatever he will help you.</br>
Even now if I come across any problem I will definitely call this guy to help me, because I know this guy will help me or give me some solution to solve that problem.</br>
And now this guy have got Student of The Year trophy it simply means that not oney me but also our college fellow's including teaching staff acknowledge him.</br>
This guy is one of few people for whom respect comes from the heart. And the name of that guy is Akash Wankhede.
